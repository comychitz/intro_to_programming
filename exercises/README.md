# exercises
This folder contains exercises to complete for the introduction to programming
in C++. Within this folder is a subfolder named `solutions`, which contains
example solutions to the exercise problems. Don't peek unless you need to or are
finished with your attempt ;) 

Many of the exercises are already partially completed, to allow you to focus on
the core problem, not worrying about small details that you will learn as you
go.
